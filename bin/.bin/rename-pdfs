'''
Renames PDF files to match their embeded title

This script has some problems so don't rely on it too much.

This requires PyPDF2 to be installed;
which can be installed like so:

python3 -m pip install --user PyPDF2
'''

from os import listdir, rename
from os.path import isfile, join
from sys import argv

try:
    import PyPDF2
except ImportError:
    print('''This command requires PyPDF2 library
Please install it with this:
python3 -m pip install --user PyPDF2''')


for path in argv[1:]:
    pdf_files = [path + '/' + f for f in listdir(path) if isfile(join(path, f))]

    for f in pdf_files:
        pdf = PyPDF2.PdfFileReader(f)

        if '/Title' in pdf.documentInfo:
            title = path + '/' + pdf.documentInfo['/Title'] + '.pdf'
            print(f'Renaming [{f}] to [{title}]')
            rename(f, title)
        else:
            print(f'Cannot rename {f} has no PDF title')
