'''
Renames PDF files to match their embeded title

This script has some problems so don't rely on it too much.

This requires PyPDF2 to be installed.
If you have python3 with pip installed PyPDF2 can be added like so.

python3 -m pip install --user PyPDF2
'''

import PyPDF2
from os import listdir, rename
from os.path import isfile, join
from sys import argv

for path in argv[1:]:
    pdf_files = [path + '/' + f for f in listdir(path) if isfile(join(path, f))]

    for f in pdf_files:
        pdf = PyPDF2.PdfFileReader(f)

        if '/Title' in pdf.documentInfo:
            title = path + '/' + pdf.documentInfo['/Title'] + '.pdf'
            print(f'Renaming [{f}] to [{title}]')
            rename(f, title)
        else:
            print(f'Cannot rename {f} has no PDF title')
